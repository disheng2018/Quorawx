**Proximity**.

I’ll explain.

When you first start dating it’s super super easy, you (usually) hang out once, twice, **thrice** a week. The conditions are controlled and for small **spans** of time.

It’s easy to keep your happy face on.

Want to find out if your relationship is going to be solid?

Go on a trip together.

Go through the planning, then get packed, go to the airport together, be exposed to the stresses of travel, the hotels, the rental cars, the <u>splitting of the bills</u>, the sharing of hotel beds, the sharing of a bathroom sink for a solid 5 days.

While you do this - you will likely spend 80% of your time within 5–10 feet of each other.

Proximity.

Over those days, you’ll quickly find out just how well you tolerate each other.

Traveling is a fantastic relationship test. It keeps you in close **quarters** while also putting you both out of your comfort zones.

Naturally good couples can spend long spans of time around each other in differing conditions. Unnaturally good couples quickly fall apart under this test.

If your <u>significant other</u> suddenly starts getting mad at the way you brush your teeth every morning, it’s not a good sign.
