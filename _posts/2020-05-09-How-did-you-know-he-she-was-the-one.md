A girl texted my boyfriend.

At that time our relationship had just begun. After only one month of being officially together, we both moved to different cities because of college. 15 hours by car separated us. We could see each other only when the flight ticket wasn't too expensive. So we started a long distance relationship.

Back to this girl (let's call her Sarah) , she was a freshman too and they were attending the same medicine school. My boyfriend is extremely friendly so he immediately got along with everybody; he made the soccer team and he <u>integrated</u> very well. The girl <u>in question</u> texted him:

"Hey, it's me Sarah. It's impossible not to notice you. You seem very <u>laid-back</u>. And <u>a feast for the eyes</u>, if you know what I mean ;). Let me know if you would like to hang out just the two of us sometimes"

Only months later, around Christmas 2018, I casually saw the conversation and so I read it.

His reply was:

"I think I've already mentioned to you that I've a girlfriend"

"You did but I'm good at keeping secrets ;) "

**"I appreciate you had the guts to text me, but seriously don't waste your time on me. I love and respect my girlfriend, and myself, way too much to ruin everything. Have a nice day, Sarah!"**

And that, ladies and gentlemen, was the moment I realized he was the one.
