**Following these 6 steps:**

1. Wake up at 7:30 am.
2. Don’t check your phone.
3. Put it on airplane mode.
4. Hide it in another room, under a pillow.
5. Do work for the entire day.
6. Go to sleep.

If you do this successfully - you’ve got incredible self-control.

**We’re entirely addicted to our smartphones.** Notifications, **pings**, emails, messages.  We get a tiny rush each time we see what’s behind that red number.

Those who can resist are now in the top 1% of the developed world.

Become aware of your addiction and deal with it.

Turn off every push notification - *it can wait.*

Respond on your time, not someone else.

**Become notification-free.**
